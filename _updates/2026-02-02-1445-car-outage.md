## Summary
TST suffered an outage of the Rental Car product due to a massive traffic spike overwhelming the application.

## Customer impact
Both consumers and agents would have had intermittent issues shopping for and booking Rental Cars.

## Timeline (ET)
- **14:43** - TST Car application begins receiving traffic, quickly spiking to more than 100x a normal daily peak.
- **14:47** - TST Car application replicas become fully saturated, alerts triggered.
- **15:04** - Manual measures are taken to considerably increase Car application replica count.

## Root cause
No specific source of the traffic has been identified at this time, and the investigation is continuing. A large number of IP addresses were involved, but all showed signs of being from the same source, attempting to scrape pricing data out of the Car Search.

## Mitigation and resolution
- Resolution: Manual intervention to increase Car application replicas and resources beyond its standard limit.

## Prevention
- Additional replica scaling allowed for Car Application while the investigation is ongoing
- Investigating the source of queries and options to block the traffic.
