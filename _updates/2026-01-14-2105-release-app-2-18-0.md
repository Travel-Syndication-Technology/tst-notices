- Improved reliability of background jobs by adding smarter retry backoff.
- Expanded audit events for key account and permission changes.

## Release notes
### Added
- Billing history view with export capability.
- Audit log entries for role changes and API key lifecycle events.

### Changed
- Background job retry behavior now uses exponential backoff to reduce contention during partial outages.
- Account settings navigation reorganized for faster access to common actions.

### Fixed
- Corrected an edge case where invoice PDFs could render with missing line-item totals.
- Reduced intermittent timeouts when loading large audit log pages.

## Known issues
- Some older browsers may display a fallback billing chart style. A compatibility update is planned.

## Rollback plan
- If critical issues are detected, revert traffic to the previous release and disable new billing UI via feature flag.
- Re-run invoice export verification on rollback completion.

## Customer impact
- No downtime expected. Minor UI changes may require a short adjustment period for billing admins.
